# Multilingual-Culinary-Chatbot

## Description
The Multilingual Culinary Chatbot is an advanced, interactive tool designed to assist users in finding recipes based on available ingredients. This chatbot extends beyond simple searches to offer personalized recipe recommendations using sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By parsing user inputs with spaCy and NLTK for tokenization, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition, it provides accurate suggestions that align with users' pantry inventories. Additionally, its multilingual capabilities, powered by TextBlob, allow users to access recipes in their preferred language, making culinary discovery a global affair.

- Interactive chatbot interface for recipe recommendations
- NLP-powered ingredient analysis for precise recipe matching
- Multilingual support for recipe details (titles, ingredients, instructions)
- Visual data insights through word clouds and exploratory data analysis
- TF-IDF weighting and cosine similarity for relevance-based suggestions
